### Pathofysiologie

##### Essential Surgery: Problems, Diagnosis and Management
An abscess is a collection of pus (dead and dying neutrophils plus proteinaceous exudate) walled off by a zone of acute inflammation. 

- Acute abscess formation particularly occurs in response to certain **pyogenic** microorganisms that attract neutrophils but are resistant to phagocytosis and lysosomal destruction. 
- Abscesses also form in response to localised tissue necrosis and to some organic foreign bodies (e.g., wood splinters, linen suture material). 
- The main pyogenic organisms of surgical importance are _Staphylococcus aureus_ , some streptococci (particularly _Streptococcus pyogenes_ ), _Escherichia coli_ and related gram-negative bacilli (‘coliforms’), and _Bacteroides_ species (spp.).

##### Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease
**Purulent inflammation is characterized by the production of pus, an exudate consisting of neutrophils, the liquefied debris of necrotic cells, and edema fluid.** The most frequent cause of purulent (also called suppurative) inflammation is infection with bacteria that cause liquefactive tissue necrosis, such as staphylococci; these pathogens are referred to as pyogenic (pus-producing) bacteria. A common example of an acute suppurative inflammation is acute appendicitis.

The creamy material known as pus comprises dead neutrophils.
