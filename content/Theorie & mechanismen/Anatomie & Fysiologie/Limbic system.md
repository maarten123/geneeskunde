Involved in emotions, pain and stress

##### Prefrontal cortex

- Personality  
- Emotions  
- Motivation  
- Planning  
- Decision making

Information from other brain regions on taste, olfaction, visual  and auditive information for making affective decisions.

#### Limbic system
‘Outer-ring’ (cortical):  
- Cingulate Gyrus/prefrontal and orbital cortex 
- Parahippocampal Gyrus

‘Inner-ring’, (subcortical):  
- Hippocampus with Fornix 
- [[Amygdala]] with stria terminalis
- Thalamus  
- Hypothalamus  
- Pituitary gland  
- Septum  
- Hippocampus

#### Circuit of Papez (1937)

#### ‘Extended Limbic System’   
- Hypothalamus  
and parts of  
- Thalamus  
- Insula  
- Brainstem

#### Anterior Cingulate Gyrus

#### Hippocampus
Hippocampus is a cortical region, but because it lays inside the brain, a lot of people call it a subcortical region.

##### Input and output
![|350](https://i.imgur.com/scbpQfO.png)
Information is not stored in the hippocampus itself, but it plays a part in storing information.

Information from cortex regions goes to hippocampus, is reinforced (consolidated) and projected again to the cortex.

Navigation virtual environment: right hippocampus active.

**Antero-posterior functional specialisation**  
**Anterior**: novel material input activity shifts to **Posterior** development of familiarity with  
repeated exposure; involved in long-term memory.

Hippocampus: spatial and episodic memory  
Significant larger posterior right hippocampus London taxi drivers

##### Hippocampus and spatial memory

- **Place cells** in hippocampus determine were we are
- **Grid cells** in entorhinal cortex constitute a coordinate system for spatial navigation together forming circuits with the place cells in the hippocampus.

In neurodegenerative: cells that store new information degenerate first, older information is intact, but short term memory lost. 

#### Amygdala; fear and anger
Involved in fear and anger. Input from all over the brain, most cortical afferents are from sensory modalities to amygdala.

Damaged amygdala: [[Kluver Bucy syndrome]]> hyperorality, hypersexuality, no fear

##### Output amygdala
![|300](https://i.imgur.com/Mx0mhtB.png)
PBN= parabrachial nucleus, CN= nucleus ceruleus MRN= magnus raphe nucleus

Amygdala projects on hypothalamus, thus involved in hormonal regulations. 
Projects to PAG for pain control.

##### Stimulation induced feeding
Hypothalamus nuclei :  
- Appetite and satiety centres  
- Defensive behaviour

##### Physiological functions influenced by limbic system
Tuning physiological functions on motor system by hypothalamus
The brain adjusts physiological functions on what you are doing or in what situation you are.

##### Pain perception

Intracerebral pain processing in a Yoga  
Master who claims not to feel pain during meditation

fMRI findings during non-meditation and meditation in the  
Yoga Master following noxious YAG laser stimulation applied to the  
dorsum of the left foot. The thalamus (1), SII-insula (2) and cingulate  
cortex (3) were analyzed. During non-meditation, activities in all three  
regions were significantly increased, but during meditation, no  
activation was identified in any of the regions

#### Insula
![|250](https://i.imgur.com/o0KvEde.png)

Involved in:
- Emotion
- Pain perception
- Disgust
- Empathy 
- Intuition

##### Nucleus accumbens
- Motivational states and addictive behavior, reward, joy, pleasure, gratification. 
- Motor expression of emotional responses and gestures and behaviors.  
- Input from amygdala, hypocampal formation, dopaminergic (DA) input from ventral tegmental area

- Influence of limbic system on motor and sensory system via a.o. n Raphe production Serotonin, serotonergic projection ‘total brain’ and spinal cord depression  
- Motor system  
- Sensory system (Pain regulation!)


#### Stress response: sensory, motor and visceral
Important factors:  
- predictability  
- controllable

Limbic system influences:  
- Motor system
