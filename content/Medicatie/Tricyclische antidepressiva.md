##### Tricyclic antidepressants

This graphic shows the pharmacological activity of many of the [tricyclic antidepressants](https://www.farmacotherapeutischkompas.nl/bladeren/groepsteksten/tricyclische_antidepressiva) (TCA). Like the SSRI's, the tricyclic's mechanism of action seems to work in stages (stage 1-4). However, the difference is that the tricyclic [[Antidepressiva|antidepressants]] can block either the serotonin or norepinephrine transporter, or both.

The receptor affinity profile of [[amitriptyline]] is used as a representative of this class of agents. Amitriptyline was chosen as it demonstrates the lack of specificity that the SSRI's provide. Other tricyclic antidepressants include:
- [[Clomipramine]]
- [[Imipramine]]
- [[Nortriptyline]]

Due to this lack of specificity, the clinician should monitor the patient for the emergence of side effects from the blockade of muscarinic, histaminergic and alpha-adrenergic receptors. Anti-cholinergic side effects include e.g. dry mouth, dizziness, constipation, tachycardia, excessive perspiration and miction problems.

Orthostatic hypotension and dizziness are caused by the anti-α1 adrenergic effects of TCAs. The anti-histaminergic effects result in sedation.

The strong affinity that tricyclic antidepressants have for various receptors is also a cause for concern for safety as large or multiple doses can lead to significant toxic effects (i.e. muscarinic blockade: confusion and blockade of fast sodium channels (via a quinidine-like effect): cardiac arrhythmias).

Antidepressants in general may produce a discontinuation syndrome (characterised by restlessness, sleeping problems, GI-complaints, and flu-like symptoms), which can be managed by a gradual reduction in dosage over a period of weeks or months.
