> [!ETIO]  **Purpose of western blotting**
>  To quantify the relative levels of a specific protein in different samples (normalized to the level of a control/’housekeeping’ protein);
	> - For the accomplishment of the western blot, there are three elements, separation of proteins by size, transferring proteins to a solid support, and marking proteins by primary and secondary antibodies for visualization.

>- 1. Make an RNA extract from a sample (tissue or cells).
>- 2. Use gel electrophoresis to separate RNA molecules according to their molecular weight.
>- 3. Transfer the RNA molecules from the gel to a membrane (blotting).
>- 4. Detect the RNA molecule of interest by using a labeled probe. This probe is complementary to a specific RNA sequence that is part of the RNA molecule of interest.
>- 5. (after a washing step), visualize the labeled probe (typically the probe is radiolabeled, which can be visualized on X-ray film.
>- **Applications**
	> 1. The technique can be used for the identification and separation of RNA fragments collected from different biological sources.
	> 2. Northern blotting is used as a sensitive test for the detection of transcription of DNA fragments that are to be used as a probe in Southern Blotting.
	> 3. It also allows the detection and quantification of specific mRNAs from different tissues and different living organisms.
	> 4. Northern blotting is used as a tool for gene expression studies related to overexpression of cancer-causing genes, and gene expression during transplant rejects.
	> 5. Northern blotting has been used as a molecular tool for the diagnosis of diseases like Crohn’s disease.
	> 6. The process is used as a method for the detection of viral microRNAs that play important roles in viral infection.
