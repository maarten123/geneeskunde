## Part 1: Abdominal 
**Positioning**
Two positions:
- Supine position.
	- Surgeon operates from the right side
- Low lithotomy position.
	- Surgeon operates from between the legs of the patient. 
---
**Steps**
1. Mobilisation greater curvature: 
	- Create access to lesser sac through gastrocolic ligament
	- Dissect gastrocolic ligament along greater curvature just cranial of the transverse colon. (including preparation for later omentoplasty)
	- Dissect retrogastric adhesions onto the left crus
	- Complete dissection of gastrocolic ligament by dissecting from initiation site back to the pylorus/proximal duodenum
	- Dissect retrogastric adhesions along the pancreas to the lesser curvature
2. Mobilisation lesser curvature
3. Access to celiac trunk
4. Abdominal lymph node dissection
5. Mobilization of distal esophagus in the hiatus
6. Creation of gastric tube
---
## Part 2: Thoracic 
Preparation for thoracoscopic phase:
**Positioning**

**Steps**
1. Thoracic access
2. Mobilization of thoracic esophagus
3. Identification and dissection of thoracic vessels
4. Thoracic lymph node dissection
5. Thoracotomy and removal of specimen
6. Thoracic stapled E/S anastomosis
7. Thoracic stapled S/S anastomosis

**Ending**
1. Omentoplasty
2. Placement of drains
3. Irrigation and inspection
4. Removal of trocars and port/thoracotomy closure
5. Placement of nasogastric tube
6. Jejunostomy placement

### The MIE procedure as in the MIE-CAT tool
The steps of the MIE procedure are represented in the MIE-CAT tool as phases. These phases are:
1. Mobilization greater curvature: in this phase the greater curvature of the stomach is dissected. This phase aims to completely mobilize the stomach. In this step the gastrocolic ligament and the retrogastric adhesions are dissected. 
2. Mobilization lesser curvature: in this step the stomach wil be mobilised onto the diafragm. The lesser curvature and the gastrohepatic ligament are dissected. 
3. Dissection abdominal lymph nodes: the common hepatic artery nodes, the left gastric artery nodes, the celiac trunk nodes, the proximal splenic artery nodes, the left paracardial nodes and the right paracardial nodes are dissected. 
4. Dissection hiatus: the peritoneum of the distal esophagus is dissected and the phrenoesophageal ligaments are transected. 
5. Creation gastric tube: ?
6. Mobilization thoracic esophagus: the thoracic esophagus is mobilised by dissecting the inferior pulmonary ligament, the esophagal part of the pleura, the pleura alongside the azygos vein, transection of the arcus of the azygos vein, dissection of the peri-esophageal aorta branches and lymph vessels. 
7. Dissection thoracic lymph nodes: the subcarinal, middle mediastinal paraesophageal and the right pulmonary ligament limph nodes are dissected. 
8. Creation intrathoracic anastomosis: an anastomosis is created between the oesophageal and gastric tube. The two are connected with a EEA stapler.
