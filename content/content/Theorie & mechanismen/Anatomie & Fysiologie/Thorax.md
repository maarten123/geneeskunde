# Thorax

The tendon sheath of the m. rectus abdominis changes in its configuration.

At one-third of the m. transversus abdominis, the dorsal component of the sheath disappears. All the different aponeurosis sheaths run ventrally of the m. rectus abdominis.

This point is called the linea arcuata

The innervation of the body wall is divided in segments as well.  At each vertebral level segmental nerves originate.

Mainly, the motoric and sensoric function of the thoracic region is provided by twelve spinal nerves.
